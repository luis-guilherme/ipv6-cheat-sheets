## IPv6 cheat sheet ##

### Address length and format ###

The IPv6 address is **128 bits** (i.e. 16 bytes) long and is written in **8 groups of 2 bytes** in hexadecimal numbers separated by colons:

    FDDD:F00D:CAFE:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001

Leading zeros of each block can be omitted, the above address can hence be written like this:

    FDDD:F00D:CAFE:0:0:0:0:1

We can abbreviate whole blocks of zeros with `::` and write:

    FDDD:F00D:CAFE::1

This can only be done *once* in order to void ambiguity:

    FF:0:0:0:1:0:0:1 (correct)
    FF::1:0:0:1 (correct)
    FF:0:0:0:1::1 (correct)
    FF::1::1 (ambiguous, wrong)

### Protocols ###

| Number | Protocol  | Purpose                                   |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|  58    | IPv6-ICMP | Information, Error reporting, diagnostics |
|  6     | TCP       | Stateful - controls if packets arrived    |
| 17     | UDP       | Stateless - streaming applications etc.   |

### Ways to  assign IPv6 addresses ###

**Static** - fixed address  
**SLAAC** - Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (host generates itself)  
**DHCPv6** - Dynamic host configuration protocol (assigned by central server)  

### Scopes and special addresses ###

**GLOBAL** - everything (i.e. the whole internet)  
**UNIQUE LOCAL** - everything in our LAN (behind the internet gateway)  
**LINK LOCAL** - (will never be routed, valid in one collision domain, i.e. on the same switch)  

| range     | Purpose                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ::1/128   | Loopback address (localhost)                   |
| ::/128    | unspecified address                            |
| 2000::/3  | GLOBAL unicast (Internet)                      |
| FC00::/7  | Unique-local (LAN)                             |
| FE80::/10 | Link-Local Unicast (same switch)               |

Always use the smallest possible scope for communication  
A host can have **multiple** addresses in different scopes

### Subnetting ###

| bits (MSB)      | Purpose                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| First 48 bits:  | **Network** address     |
| Next 16 bits:   | **Subnet** address      |
| Last 64 bits:   | **Device** address      |

**Network+Subnet = Prefix**

The following address

    2003:1000:1000:1600:1234::1

would have the network `2003:1000:1000`, the subnet `1600`, so together the prefix `2003:1000:1000:1600`. If the ISP provider **delegated** a part of the prefix to me (e.g. `2003:1000:1000:1600/56`) then I could use the subnets from `2003:1000:1000:1600` to `2003:1000:1000:16FF` for my own purposes (i.e. define 256 subnets in this example)

### IPv6 addresses in URIs/URLs ###

Because IPv6 address notation uses colons to separate hextets, it is necessary to encase the address in square brackets in URIs. For example `http://[2a00:1450:4001:82a::2004]`. If you want to specify a port, you can do so as normal using a colon: `http://[2a00:1450:4001:82a::2004]:80`.
